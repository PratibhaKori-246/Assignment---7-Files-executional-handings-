    "\n",
    "If the primary bottleneck is waiting for I/O operations, such as network requests, file I/O, database operations, or any input/output process that involves waiting for external data, multithreading is more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¸Tasks with Shared Memory Needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "When tasks need to share large amounts of data or maintain a shared state, multithreading is preferable since threads can access the same memory space.\n",

    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¸CPU-Bound Tasks:\n",

    "A process pool is a programming construct used to manage a collection of worker processes that can execute tasks concurrently. It simplifies the management of multiple processes by providing an abstraction for distributing work to a fixed number of processes, which can be reused for different tasks. This is especially useful when working with multiprocessing for CPU-bound operations.\n",

    "2. Task Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reusing Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Managing Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s how it achieves efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prevents Resource Exhaustion:\n",
    "\n",
    "By maintaining a fixed number of worker processes, a process pool ensures that the number of active processes does not exceed the system's capacity. This prevents resource exhaustion, such as running out of memory or overwhelming the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optimizes Core Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Process pools are often configured to match the number of CPU cores, maximizing the utilization of multi-core processors without creating more processes than the system can handle efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Efficient Task Dispatching:\n",
    "\n",
    "A process pool manages a queue of tasks and assigns them to available worker processes, streamlining the process of distributing work.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Automatic Task Queuing:\n",
    "\n",
    "If all processes in the pool are busy, new tasks are automatically queued, waiting for a worker to become available. This avoids the need to manually manage a task queue or worry about scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Fault Isolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event of a worker process crashing due to an error in a particular task, it does not affect the other workers in the pool. The pool can simply handle the error, recycle the failed process, and continue processing other tasks.\n"

    "\n",
    "When using threads in Python (via the threading module), multiple threads run within the same process and share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Lock: A Lock is a basic synchronization primitive that allows only one thread to access a shared resource at a time. When a thread acquires a lock, other threads must wait until the lock is released before they can acquire it.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. RLock (threading.RLock): A reentrant lock allows the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times. This is useful when the lock is needed in recursive functions or when a function that requires a lock calls another function that also needs the same lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Condition :\n",
    "\n",
    "A Condition is used for thread coordination. It allows one thread to wait until notified by another thread that a certain condition is true. A Condition object is always associated with a lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. . Semaphore (threading.Semaphore)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Semaphore allows a limited number of threads to access a resource. It is useful when you need to limit access to a resource, such as limiting concurrent database connections.\n",
